# PolySpline

[ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://js.arcgis.com/) extension that creates splines from polylines.

A live demo is available here: https://arnofiva.github.io/polyspline

[![screenshot](./demo/screenshot.png)](https://arnofiva.github.io/polyspline)

The live demo shows one of the long roundtrip cruise of the [ZSG, ZÃ¼richsee Schifffahrtsgesellschaft](https://www.zsg.ch/en/timetable-prices/round-trips-scheduled-cruises/dep-zurich).

## Usage

To use the library you must first tell Dojo to load it and import the `SplineLayerProxy` class using `require`:

```
<script type="text/javascript">
  var dojoConfig = {
    packages: [{
      name: "polyspline",
      location: "https://arnofiva.github.io/polyspline/lib/",
    }]
  };
</script>
<script src="https://js.arcgis.com/4.12/"></script>

<script>

require([
  "esri/Map",
  "esri/views/SceneView",

  "polyspline/layers/SplineLayerProxy",
], function(
  Map,
  SceneView,

  SplineLayerProxy,
) {

  // Your source code goes here

}
</script>
```

Pass a [`FeatureLayer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html) or [`GeoJSONLayer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-GeoJSONLayer.html) with polyline geometries to SplineLayerProxy and it will create a new layer where all features are rendered as smooth lines.

```
var route = new GeoJSONLayer({
  url: "./cruise.geojson",
});

var splineProxy = new SplineLayerProxy({
  lineLayer: route,
});

splineProxy.whenSplineLayer().then(function(smoothRoute) {
  map.add(smoothRoute);
});

```
